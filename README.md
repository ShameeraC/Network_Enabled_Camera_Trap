# Network-Enabled Camera Trap
This project deals with improving existing research equipment for ornithologists. One of the major concerns faced by researchers studying red-winged starlings at the University of Cape Town and its surrounding area, is that they are lacking the necessary funds and manpower to monitor their feeding and nesting behaviour. To address this issue, our team has decided to design a network-enabled camera trap.

The camera trap uses a PIR sensor to trigger a photo being taken. The photo is then saved to an  SD card, along with environmental data such as temperature and humidity measured by the camera trap's sensor. Afterwards, the camera trap uploads the saved image to Google Drive as well.

This repository details the design, testing, documentation and implementation of a network-enabled camera trap aimed at solving these problems completed by [Shameera Cassim](https://github.com/ShameeraC), [Thato Khoabane](https://github.com/kingtysen1969), [Litha Nohashe](https://github.com/lithanohasheUCT) and [Stefan Friedrich](https://github.com/stefanfriedric).
